"""
Welcome. Let's do some Python!

Click the green arrow at top to run your program.

When program runs it will trigger tests in the background which will let you know how you did.

The tests are in the files starting with "test_" E.g. test_functions.py. When you're ready to move on to next test then comment out (or remove) the line above the next test.

E.g. @pytest.mark.skip("comment out to run test")


NOTE: the below code triggers the running of the tests. Don't modify this part. We'll talk about what's happening behind the scenes in class.
